# aws-site

## Architecture Overview:

This repository contains the infrastructure and configuration for deploying a web application on AWS using EC2, Docker, Route53, and Nginx. The architecture includes the following components:

- An **EC2** instance running Amazon Linux AMI with an IAM role that provides access to ECR.
- The **primary application** running in a Docker container.
- A **Route53 A record** that maps the domain name to the IP address of the EC2 instance.
- **SSL certificates** generated by Certbot for secure communication.
- A **Nginx reverse proxy** running in a Docker container, configured to proxy traffic to the primary application and handle SSL termination.
